Installation Instructions:

1. Run the installer script
If your command line shell is:
- Bash: run ./installer.sh
- zsh: replace all occurrences of '~/.bashrc' in the installer.sh file to '~/.zshrc', then run ./installer.sh (will have separate install file for this soon)

2. Source your run commands file based on your shell:
source ~/.bashrc # bash
source ~/.zshrc # zsh
